# Gray Foundation Data Model

This repository hosts the data model used for the Gray Foundation project.

## Internal development

We use a branching model for development of the source. 
Create a branch starting with `dm/**` to make changes in one of the files in `modules`, then submit a pull request.
This will run some automated checks and "compile" the full model files (`.csv` and `.jsonld`).
